    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about-description">
      TechMinds was born from a spark— a spark of passion and purpose. I still remember when I entered class 12 and saw my peers crumble under the fear of physics, especially the electrical science related topics. I observed they considered it as a hard subject to understand. Many of them took those science subjects thinking them as a way only to a secure job in future, because of this they could not enjoy learning electrical science.
      I also remember when I entered on a school trip to a science hub, I was mesmerized by the electronic tools laid out for display. I reached out to learn. But I was stopped because according to the staff there I was too young to explore them and learn. I was denied not because of my curiosity— but because of my age. That rejection motivated me to build something. Over time, I realized that many things that hold students back— like a lack of resources, coming from underprivileged communities, or simply not being able to understand the topics. We founded TechMinds to break those walls down. Today, TechMinds runs electrical science programs with over 140 participants who joined from countries like USA, Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Nepal. We are building a global community where learning is joyful, concepts are clear, and curiosity is celebrated.
      This is more than an organization. This is a movement. A movement to make electrical sciences approachable, understandable, and even fun— especially for those curious learners who had less access to it. A movement to bring learning to those who are passionate but lacking — because of age, background, or lack of resources.
      A movement I started, not because I had all the answers, but because I had the question: "What if every student could fall in love with electrical science the way I did?" Welcome to TechMinds.
      Let’s build that world— together.
